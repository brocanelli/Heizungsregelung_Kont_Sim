Heizungsregelung von dem Fach Kontinuerliche Simulation an der TU Wien

Matlab Project.

It simulates one heated room and different types of heating regulators, reporting all datas in a graph.
All parameters are possible to modify and through a variable it can be changed the type of heating regulation.

The actual final relevant Matlab program is Heizungsregelung_4. For functioning needs (at least) as well importData.m, ode_E_Heizkurve.m and the temperatures for the months.
